## 📌 Overview

Phishing is a major cybersecurity threat, especially in **e-commerce**, where users share sensitive data like login credentials and financial details. This project aims to **detect phishing websites in real time** using advanced machine learning and deep learning models.

The system works by analyzing URL-based features and classifying them as either **phishing** or **legitimate** using models like **ANN, CNN, RNN, and KNN**.
